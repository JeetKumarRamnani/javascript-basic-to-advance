Assignment for Session 4:

You are required to write a JavaScript program that takes an input of an amount in number type and based on that number, the program should output the number of notes of different denominations, i.e., 5000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1 rupee.

For example, if the input amount is 6350, the output should be:

1. note of 5000

3 notes of 100

1. note of 50

0 notes of 1000, 500, 20, 10, 5, 2, and 1

Please note that you are not allowed to use any external tool or library for this assignment. You need to build the logic of the program yourself.
