//1-Enviroment Setup

//Vs code is an  text-editor and IDE(Integreted Development Enviroment)
// Vs code is generally Hybird of both
//Download And Install VSCODE

//Strongly Typed Langauges Statically Typed Languages
//Explicitly Batana Parta Hai App Logo Ko There Are Two Things Explicit And Implicit
//Java And C++
// int a = 23;

//Explicit And Implicit

//Explicit
//like java,c++ etc

//int myVar = 42; //you are explicitly telling c++ or java to store only these type of values
// myVar = "i am string now" this is not allowed
//String myString = "I Am A String $ % ^ 42" //ANything inside these Single Or Double Quotes Are Called Strings
//myString = 42; this is not allowed in staticly typed languages or strongly typed languages

//Implicit

//like javascript php and python

// var myVar = 42; //javascript will understand on its own that it has cetain type of value you dont have to tell javscript
//myVar  = "I AM A String" THIS IS Allowed in dynamically typed languages

//2-Data Types

// There Are 7 Datatypes In Javascript

// 1-Number

//-2 -1 0 1 2 These ARE Called Integers
//-1.1 0.01 1.1 2.3 These Are Floating

//THESE Both Are Numbers


//2-String

// 'Any thing inside double or single quotes is called string true false'

//3-Boolean

//true Or 1 true is also denoted as 1
//false Or 0 and false is also denoted as 0

//  var userIsLoggedIn = true ;

// if(userIsLoggedIn){
// Show him his feed
// }else {
// agar wo true nai hai toh ise print kardo
// }
//we will discuss if/else ya conditional logic soon

//4- Null

// there is nothing ,VOID Or empty;

//  var nullExample = null;

//5-undefined

// undefined means variable is declared but not defined
// var undefinedExample; i only declare it  but i didnot defined it javascript will impicitly add undefined to this variable
//undefinedExample = undefined; you can explicityly defined it but dont need to define because javascript will define it on its own

//6- Object
// Objects Are king In Javascript everything is object in javascript
// before understanding objects we have to understand arrays

//Arrays

//Variables In Javascript

//Variable Is Like A Container/Box

//How Variable Are Defined

//in 3 ways we can define variables
//var let and cost
//let and const are part of Ecmascript 6/Ecmascript 2015
//Ecmascript is basically javascript
//we will not discuss let and const in this lecture

//we will use var
//YOU CAN GIVE Any name to your variable i gave myName
//var myName= "Jeet Kumar";

// Rules To Set Variable Name

// if you dont follow rules then javascript will throw an error
//convention: it is not necarry to follow this but if you follow it called as good practice

// Rules

// 1-variable name never be started with numbers

// Dont's
// var 1name you cant start variable name starting from a number
// var for; reserved keywords for variable names are not allowed
// var myname%; only few special characters are allowed in variable name like _ and $
// var my name; space is not allowed inside variable name
// Do's
// var name1;
//var $name;
//var my_name
//var myname;

//Convention
//var myName // good practice to give variable name in camleCase

//variable is like a box where you store any value
//you can then use that variable to manipulate your data
//variable will represent that value

// var myVar = "My nAME IS JEET";
// console.log(myVar);
// console.log(myVar);
// console.log(myVar);
// console.log(myVar);

//Case Sensitive
//java c++ javascript etc

//Case Insensitive
//php etc....

// Case Sensitive Example
// var myname = "Jeet Kumar";
// console.log(myname);
// console.log(myName); THIS IS WRONG In javascript it is not valid javascript is case sensitive language

//Case Insenstive like php
// php code example
// $myvar = "jeet kumar"
// print($myvar);
// print($MyVar)
// print($MYVAR)

// THESE ARE VALID IN PHP BECAUSE IT IS CASE INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE
